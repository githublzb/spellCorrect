Light Bulb(浙江省省赛6th)http://acm.zju.edu.cn/onlinejudge/showProblem.do?problemId=3366 zju3366


   


   


   Compared to wildleopard's wealthiness, his brother mildleopard is rather poor. His house is narrow and he has only one light bulb in his house. Every night, he is wandering in his incommodious house, thinking of how to earn more money. One day, he found that the length of his shadow was changing from time to time while walking between the light bulb and the wall of his house. A sudden thought ran through his mind and he wanted to know the maximum length of his shadow. 


   


   Input


   The first line of the input contains an integer T (T &lt;= 100), indicating the number of cases. 


   Each test case contains three real numbers H, h and D in one line. H is the height of the light bulb while h is the height of mildleopard. D is distance between the light bulb and the wall. All numbers are in range from 10-2 to 103, both inclusive, and H - h &gt;= 10-2. 


   Output


   For each test case, output the maximum length of mildleopard's shadow in one line, accurate up to three decimal places.. 


   Sample Input


   


   3
2 1 0.5
2 0.5 3
4 3 4


   


   Sample Output


   


   1.000
0.750
4.000


   


   思路：


   情况1．若影子全部落在地上，则x1(max)=Dh/H情况2．若影子一半在墙上，则x2=(D-x)(地)+s2(墙),求导得x=sqrt(D*(H-h)),但要x2&lt;D(否则人就站到墙后面去啦！)情况3 .身高最长，那就贴着墙站着吧~
