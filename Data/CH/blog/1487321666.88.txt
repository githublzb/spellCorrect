拿微软的英库做博士英语作业太爽了今天是博士英语作业的deadline，一大早爬起来做作业，发现好难，前不久周明博士来系里作报告推荐了英库，用了一把，作业20分钟就搞定了，英库真是天才。


    作业如下，这里不表，先说说几个好用的功能。


    （1）选择追加形容词搭配


    比如第三题，我想知道option有哪些前缀形容词可以修饰，就用【adj. option】搜索，结果很满意。


    （2）选择合适的名词


    比如第七题，我想知道享受特权，这个特权怎么说，就用【enjoy 特权】搜索，结果依然很满意。


   


    不过还是有些不尽如人意的地方，当然人家做这个不是为了给我做作业，但还是有些功能挺实用的，比如


    我想搜索The moon can be said to be like a large mirror中间be said to be like可以替换成什么，如果可以搜索


    【The moon can{}a large mirror.】就好了，可以让检索引擎自动提供{}中可能出现的短语。


    这个功能在写论文的时候，很实用。
