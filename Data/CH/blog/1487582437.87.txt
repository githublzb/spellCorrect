ZOJ Special AC StringSince today is so special, ZOJ would only accept a special kind of strings to pass its tests. The AC rules are given as the following: 


   


1. there are only three distinct capital letters of the strings: Z, O, and J; 
2. any string that is in the form xZOJxO is acceptable, where x is a string either empty or composed of O's only; 
3. if aZbJc is acceptable, then aZbOJcO is acceptable, where a, b and c are all strings either empty or composed of O's only. 


   


   Now it is your job to write a special judge program to tell if an input string is an AC string. 


   Input


   The input consists of multiple test cases, each occupies a line containing the input string with length greater than 1 and less than 100. The string consists of only 'Z', 'O', and 'J'. Proceed until the end of file. 


   Output


   For each test case, print in a line "Accepted" if the string is acceptable, or "Wrong Answer" if not. 


   Sample Input


   ZOJO
OZOJOO
OZOOJOOO
OZOZOJOO
OOZOOJO


   Sample Output


   Accepted
Accepted
Accepted
Wrong Answer
Wrong Answer
